**Vision for LH Constitution**

Please use this document as a guide for modifying the LH constitution. 

1. This document is based on the Constitution of the United States of America, because this is probably the most functional example we have available of such a document. Constitutions of European countries that have succumbed to globalism or disarmed their population in the hopes of starving them and forcing them to eat ze bugs, probably won't give us the results they need. Would you use code that caused your computer to crash, to write a new program? 
2. Items that have caused historic problems in the USA, shall be removed. For example, the income tax amendment. 
3. Items that will not serve LH, or have lead to the decline of the empire, will be removed. 
4. Numbering, titles, headers, and even the article / section numbering system may be totally changed to provide a fluid and well-arranged document. 
5. The following organizational structure will be crafted: 
      1. Federation of LH properties co-owned by "citizens." Each property may be considered a colony, community, etc. 
      2. At the beginning, top-down small business model with a single executive 
      3. As more property owners join, a congress is formed of the group of property owners and some executive powers are automatically granted to the congress 
6. Refer to the LH fork of ULEX Law as the legal code. 
7. Add a section regarding political ponerology, and failsafes to prevent sociopaths and psychopaths from being concentrated in positions of power.
